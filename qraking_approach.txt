# qraking approach in R


## Matrix Q calibration

# Arguments

# Q : initialisation of the matrix Q
# w : calibration weights
# Xs : auxilary variables used to obtain the w

# In the function :
	# a matrix TTT is included where TTT[,i] is the total of the auxilary variables (the same as in Xs) at the level of the domain i : it refers to t^d_x in the article
	# ver is the sufficient small positive real (defined as epsilon in the article)
